**LinkUnbound** is a free, open source **browser picker**, **browser chooser** and **default browser manager** for Windows and macOS. Every link you click — in Teams, Outlook, Slack, Discord, a PDF, an email client, wherever — gets intercepted. If there's a domain rule, the assigned browser opens instantly. If not, a small **browser selection popup** appears next to your cursor so you can pick the right browser for that link.

Think of it as a lightweight **link router** / **URL router** and **browser switcher** that sits between your operating system and your browsers. Perfect for separating **work and personal browsing**, routing client domains to specific browser profiles, or handling multiple browsers without changing the system default every time.

This isn't a company product or a startup. I'm a solo developer who got tired of the OS deciding which browser opens a link, built this for myself, and decided to share it with the community. **No ads, no telemetry, no analytics, no accounts, no subscriptions, no cloud, no data collection.** Just a small native tool that lives on your machine and nowhere else.

## What It Does

- **Registers as default browser** — intercepts every link click system-wide on Windows and macOS
- **Shows a floating picker** near your cursor to choose a browser
- **Saves per-domain rules** — "always open this domain in X"
- **Resolves redirects** and Microsoft SafeLinks before matching rules
- **Runs silently** in the system tray (or menu bar on macOS) — launches on startup, stays out of the way
- **Detects installed browsers** automatically — or add custom ones manually
- **Supports multiple languages** — English and Spanish, with automatic detection

---

## What It Is / What It Isn't

**LinkUnbound is:**

- A **local-first browser picker** and **default browser manager** for Windows and macOS
- A lightweight **browser switcher** and **browser selector** that works offline
- An **open source** tool you can trust — GPL v3, inspect every line, fork it, contribute

**LinkUnbound is not:**

- A browser, toolbar, or extension
- A telemetry or analytics tool
- A "platform" with accounts, subscriptions, or ads
- A corporate product — it's a personal project shared with the community

---

## Privacy and Security

**Everything stays local.** LinkUnbound is built on a single, non-negotiable principle: your data never leaves your computer.

- **Local-only storage** — browser list, domain rules, and logs stay on your machine
- **URL redaction** — URLs are automatically redacted in logs at write time; the log file never contains actual URLs
- **No tracking** — no telemetry, no analytics, no hidden collection
- **No accounts** — no sign-up, no login, no profiles
- **One network request** — a read-only check against GitHub Releases API for updates (no user data sent, works offline)

**By design, LinkUnbound will never have:** accounts, subscriptions, ads, cloud sync, or data collection of any kind.

For responsible disclosure and security contact info, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Full privacy details in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, **or** macOS 13 (Ventura) or newer
- At least two browsers installed

### Installation

**Windows — Microsoft Store** (recommended): [Get it from Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N9F7C8Q43KC) — one click, auto-updates, no security warnings.

**Windows — standalone installer**: download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rgdevment/LinkUnbound/releases/latest).

**macOS** — install via Homebrew (signed and notarized):

```bash
brew tap rgdevment/tap
brew install --cask linkunbound          # stable
brew install --cask linkunbound-beta     # pre-release
```

Or download the `.dmg` directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rgdevment/LinkUnbound/releases/latest).

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows standalone: security warnings</strong></summary>

Since LinkUnbound is an independent open source project, the installer uses a self-signed certificate. Windows and your browser may show security warnings — this is normal and expected.

- **Browser:** Chrome/Edge may block the download — click Keep or Keep anyway.
- **SmartScreen:** Click More info → Run anyway (only happens once).
- **Why?** Code signing certificates cost $200–800/year. The code is 100% open source — you can inspect every line.

</details>

### Setup

**Windows:**

1. Run `linkunbound.exe`
2. On first launch, LinkUnbound scans your installed browsers and registers itself
3. In the settings window, click **Set as default** — Windows Settings opens, select LinkUnbound
4. Done — every link now goes through LinkUnbound

**macOS:**

1. Launch **LinkUnbound** from Applications (or Spotlight)
2. Open **Settings** from the menu bar icon → click **Set as default**
3. macOS prompts you to choose the default browser → select LinkUnbound
4. Done — every link now goes through LinkUnbound

---

## How It Works

**Link click with a rule:** browser opens instantly, no UI shown.

**Link click without a rule:** a picker appears near your cursor. Pick a browser. Optionally check "Always open here" to save a rule for that subdomain.

**Settings (tray):** double-click the tray icon or right-click → Settings. Four tabs:

- **General** — browsers, default browser status, startup toggle, language
- **Rules** — all domain rules, change browser per rule, delete rules
- **About** — version, license, update notifications, support links
- **Maintenance** — export diagnostics, reset configuration, unregister

---

## Domain Rules

Rules match hierarchically. A rule for `google.com` covers `mail.google.com`, `drive.google.com`, etc., unless a more specific subdomain rule exists.

Rules are created from the picker ("Always open here") and managed in the Rules tab.

---

## Architecture

One binary, two modes:

- `linkunbound` (no args) → settings + tray/menu bar (resident process)
- `linkunbound "https://..."` (link click) → routes the URL to the resident process and exits, or operates standalone

**Windows.** A named pipe (`\\.\pipe\LinkUnbound`) links second instances to the resident process. A Windows mutex prevents duplicate residents. Default-browser registration goes through `IApplicationAssociationRegistration`.

**macOS.** Single-instance launching is handled by Launch Services; URLs arrive through `application:openURLs:` (Apple Events) which are forwarded to Dart via a `MethodChannel`. Default-browser registration uses `LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme`. The app runs as `LSUIElement` so it lives in the menu bar instead of the Dock.

---

## FAQ

**Is LinkUnbound free?**
Yes. Completely free and open source. No premium tiers, no subscriptions, no paywalls — ever.

**Does it track my browsing?**
No. LinkUnbound does not track or transmit anything. URLs are processed in memory and automatically redacted before being written to the navigation log — the log file never contains actual URLs, only privacy-safe placeholders.

**Does it need internet?**
No. LinkUnbound works fully offline. The only network request is a lightweight update check against the GitHub Releases API — no user data sent. The app works perfectly without a connection.

**Where is my data stored?**
Everything stays on your machine — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LinkUnbound\` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/LinkUnbound/` on macOS. Browser list (`browsers.json`), domain rules (`rules.json`), navigation log (`navigate.log`), and extracted icons.

**Does it work with any browser?**
Yes. LinkUnbound detects all browsers registered with the operating system. You can also add custom browsers manually with any executable path and arguments.

**Can I use it with Microsoft SafeLinks?**
Yes. LinkUnbound resolves SafeLinks and other redirect wrappers before matching domain rules, so your rules work on the actual destination URL.

## Localization

LinkUnbound supports English and Spanish with automatic language detection. You can override the language in Settings.

## Other Tools

I build free, open source tools focused on privacy and productivity. If you like LinkUnbound, you might also find these useful:

I built LinkUnbound because I was tired of my OS not letting me choose which browser opens a link. This is a personal tool, built from a real need, shared because others might need it too. Free to use, free to inspect, free forever.
