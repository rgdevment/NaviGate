# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** April 21, 2026

---

## The Short Version

**Everything stays on your computer.** LinkUnbound does not collect, transmit, or share any of your data. There is no cloud, no accounts, no telemetry, no analytics, no tracking. Nothing leaves your machine.

This is a technical fact you can verify yourself: the entire source code is [open and public](https://github.com/rgdevment/LinkUnbound). Read the code, run a network monitor, check for yourself.

---

## Privacy Philosophy

LinkUnbound was built with privacy as the foundation, not an afterthought. Every design decision starts from the same principle: **your data stays on your machine.**

- **Local-only by design** — Your data never leaves your computer.
- **No telemetry** — No measurement, no tracking, no analysis of your usage.
- **No analytics** — No Google Analytics, no App Insights, no Sentry, nothing.
- **No accounts** — No sign-up, no login, no user profiles.
- **No cloud sync** — Your configuration is yours alone.
- **No automatic reporting** — Nothing is sent anywhere without your explicit action.
- **Fully auditable** — Every line of code is open source under [GPLv3](LICENSE).

## What Data Does LinkUnbound Store?

LinkUnbound stores only what it needs to function:

### Browser List

| Data               | Purpose                           | Format |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------- | :----- |
| Browser name       | Display in picker                 | JSON   |
| Executable path    | Launch the selected browser       | JSON   |
| Icon path          | Show browser icon in picker       | JSON   |
| Extra arguments    | Custom launch flags (if any)      | JSON   |
| Custom flag        | Distinguish manually-added browsers | JSON |

### Domain Rules

| Data       | Purpose                                          | Format |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| Domain     | Match URLs to a browser (e.g., `github.com`)     | JSON   |
| Browser ID | Which browser opens that domain                  | JSON   |

### Navigation Log

| Data      | Purpose                                      | Format     |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Timestamp | When a link was processed                    | Plain text |
| Log level | Severity (INFO, WARNING, etc.)               | Plain text |
| Message   | Application events and errors                | Plain text |

The navigation log **does not contain actual URLs**. All URLs are automatically redacted at write time before reaching the log file — they are replaced with privacy-safe placeholders like `https://<redacted>/2 segments`. The original URLs exist only in memory during processing and are never persisted to disk.

### Extracted Icons

Browser icons are extracted locally from installed browser executables and stored as image files. These are visual assets only.

---

## Where Is Everything Stored?

All data is stored locally under your user profile.

**Windows** — `%APPDATA%\LinkUnbound\`:

| Data     | Location                                    |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Browsers | `%APPDATA%\LinkUnbound\browsers.json`       |
| Rules    | `%APPDATA%\LinkUnbound\rules.json`          |
| Log      | `%APPDATA%\LinkUnbound\navigate.log`        |
| Icons    | `%APPDATA%\LinkUnbound\icons\`              |

**macOS** — `~/Library/Application Support/LinkUnbound/`:

| Data     | Location                                                         |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browsers | `~/Library/Application Support/LinkUnbound/browsers.json`        |
| Rules    | `~/Library/Application Support/LinkUnbound/rules.json`           |
| Log      | `~/Library/Application Support/LinkUnbound/navigate.log`         |
| Icons    | `~/Library/Application Support/LinkUnbound/icons/`               |

These folders are protected by your operating system's user account permissions. Other users on the same computer cannot access them under normal conditions.

## What LinkUnbound Does NOT Do

- Does not send data to any server.
- Does not use cookies or tracking technologies.
- Does not create user accounts or profiles.
- Does not share data with third parties.
- Does not use advertising or ad networks.
- Does not monitor your browsing activity beyond processing each link.
- Does not phone home — except the update checker described below.

---

## Network Requests

LinkUnbound makes **one type of network request**:

### Update Checker

| Detail        | Value                                                                    |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**   | Check if a newer version of LinkUnbound is available                     |
| **URL**       | `https://api.github.com/repos/rgdevment/LinkUnbound/releases/latest`     |
| **Method**    | GET (read-only)                                                          |
| **Data sent** | Standard HTTP headers only — no user data                                |
| **Frequency** | Once per application launch                                              |
| **Timeout**   | 5 seconds                                                                |
| **On failure**| Silent — the app continues working normally                              |

**Important:**

- This request is **read-only** — it only downloads a small JSON response containing the latest version number. No data is ever uploaded.
- **No URLs, no rules, no browser information, no personal data** is ever sent.
- If an update is found, a non-invasive indicator appears in the app. No automatic download or installation occurs.
- The app works fully offline if the request fails or is blocked.

### User-Initiated Navigation

When you click "Download" on an update notification, LinkUnbound opens the GitHub release page in your default browser. This is a standard browser navigation initiated by your action — LinkUnbound does not make this request itself.

---

## Microsoft Store Distribution

LinkUnbound is available through the Microsoft Store. The Store version:

- **Follows the same privacy principles** as the standalone version.
- **Makes the same single read-only request** to check for updates via the GitHub Releases API.
- **Uses MSIX packaging** — installs and uninstalls cleanly with standard Windows mechanisms.
- **Microsoft Store policies** apply to distribution, but LinkUnbound itself does not share any data with Microsoft beyond what the Store platform requires for installation and updates.

For Microsoft's own privacy practices, refer to [Microsoft's Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

---

## Data Deletion

### In-App

Settings → **Maintenance** tab provides:

- **Reset configuration** — clears all browsers, rules, and icons, then re-scans installed browsers.
- **Unregister** — removes LinkUnbound's browser registration from Windows.

### Complete Removal

**Windows:**

1. Uninstall LinkUnbound (via Settings → Apps or the standalone uninstaller).
2. Delete the data folder: `%APPDATA%\LinkUnbound\`

**macOS:**

1. Drag `LinkUnbound.app` from `/Applications` to the Trash (or `brew uninstall --cask linkunbound`).
2. Delete the data folder: `~/Library/Application Support/LinkUnbound/`
3. Optional: remove preferences (`~/Library/Preferences/cl.apirest.linkunbound.plist`) and saved app state (`~/Library/Saved Application State/cl.apirest.linkunbound.savedState/`).

After these steps, no LinkUnbound data remains on your system.

---

## Diagnostics Export

LinkUnbound includes an optional **Export diagnostics** feature (Settings → Maintenance) that generates a ZIP file for troubleshooting. This file is created locally and **never sent automatically** — you choose whether and where to share it.

### What the ZIP Contains

| File              | Content                                                                                       |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `system_info.txt` | OS version, locale, app version, executable path, data files                                  |
| `registry.txt`    | LinkUnbound's own Windows registry entries (Windows only)                                     |
| `navigate.log`    | Last 200 lines of the navigation log (URLs already redacted)                                  |

### What the ZIP Does NOT Contain

- **Browser list** (`browsers.json`) — not included
- **Domain rules** (`rules.json`) — not included
- **Icons** — not included
- **Actual URLs** — URLs are redacted at the source (log writing), not at export time

### URL Redaction

URLs are redacted **at write time** — before they ever reach the log file on disk. Every URL is replaced with a privacy-safe placeholder that preserves only the protocol and the number of path segments:

- `https://mail.google.com/inbox/123` → `https://<redacted>/3 segments`
- `http://internal.company.net/app` → `http://<redacted>/2 segments`

This means the `navigate.log` file on your machine never contains real URLs. The diagnostics export simply copies the last 200 lines of this already-redacted log.

---

## Children's Privacy

LinkUnbound does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The application has no accounts, no registration, and no data transmission.

---

## Open Source Transparency

The best privacy policy is one you can verify. LinkUnbound is **100% open source** under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE):

- **Full source code:** [github.com/rgdevment/LinkUnbound](https://github.com/rgdevment/LinkUnbound)
- **Audit the code yourself** — every network request, every file write, every registry read.
- **Report concerns** — [open an issue](https://github.com/rgdevment/LinkUnbound/issues) or [email](mailto:github@apirest.cl).

See our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure guidelines.

---

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy changes, the changes will be:

- Committed to the public repository with a clear commit message.
- Reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
- Documented in the release notes.

Since LinkUnbound is open source, any change to privacy behavior would also be visible as a code change before it reaches you.
